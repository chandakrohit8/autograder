Student answer1---> Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction of the interaction of chemicals with water, leading to the 
decomposition of both the substance and water.  
 
Actual Answer1---> Hydrolysis is a common form of a chemical reaction where water is 
mostly used to break down the chemical bonds that exists between a particular 
substance.

| Question no. 8|
Student answer8--->  The chlorophyll pigment is responsible for the green colouration in plants. Chlorophyll is one 
among a group of pigments used to convert sunlight energy into chemical energy through the 
process of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight, and this energy is later used to 
convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. The by -product of this process is oxygen.  
Besides plants, chlorophyll is found in all photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria.  
Chlorophyll exists in several forms but chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are the most common – 
typically found in higher plants and green algae. Chlorophyll c is found  in certain marine algae and 
Chlorophyll d is found in certain species of cyanobacteria. Even rarer is Chlorophyll e – found only in 
some golden algae. Interestingly, chlorophyll has a similar structure to haemoglobin, which is found 
in red blood cells of vertebrates.   
Actual Answer8---> chlorophyll, any member of the most important class of pigments 
involved in photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted to 
chemical energy through the synthesis of organic compounds. Chlorophyll is 
found in virtually all photosynthetic o rganisms, including green plants, 
cyanobacteria, and algae. It absorbs energy from light; this energy is then used 
to convert carbon dioxide to carbohydrates.  
The chlorophyll molecule consists of a central magnesium atom surrounded by 
a nitrogen -containin g structure called a porphyrin ring; attached to the ring is a 
long carbon –hydrogen side chain, known as a phytol chain. Variations are due 
to minor modifications of certain side groups. Chlorophyll is remarkably similar 
in structure to haemoglobin, the ox ygen -carrying pigment found in the red 
blood cells of mammals and other vertebrates.
